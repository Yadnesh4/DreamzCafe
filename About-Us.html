            Dreamz Cafe, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India's favourite 
	    hangout for coffee and conversations. Popularly known as DC, we strive to 
            provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from 
            thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're 
            glad to be a part of their lives.

            We opened our first cafe in 2000 at JM Road in Pune - the youth 
            and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it continues to be 
            one of the most happening places in the city. DC to the youth is a "hangout" 
            spot where they meet people, make conversations, chill with friends and have 
            a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee. It's been an exciting 
   	    journey since then to becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the 
	    country. We're also present in different states of India, so if your travel takes 
            you there, do stop by our outlets to get a taste from back home!
